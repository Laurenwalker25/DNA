## Introduction

I create linked list implementations of a simulated [restriction enzyme cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_enzyme) (or cleaving) of a DNA molecule, addressing a real-world problem in scientific computing. I develop a `LinkStrand` class, an implementation of the `IDnaStrand` interface that uses an internal linked list to model recombinant DNA.
